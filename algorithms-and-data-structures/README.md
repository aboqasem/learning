# Problem Solving

## Devise a Plan

### 1. Understand The Problem

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?

- What are the inputs that go into the problem?

- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?

- Do I have enough information to solve the problem?

- How should I label important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

### 2. Explore Concrete Examples

- Start with simple examples.

- Progress to more complex ones.

- Explore examples with empty/invalid inputs.

### 3. Break It Down

### 4. Solve / Simplify

### 5. Look Back and Refactor

- Can you check the result?

- Can you derive the result differently?

- Can you understand it at a glance?

- Can you improve the performance of your solution?

- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
