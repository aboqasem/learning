/*
Scalar types:
A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:
  Integers:
    8-bit	    i8  	  u8
    16-bit    i16 	  u16
    32-bit    i32 	  u32
    64-bit    i64	    u64
    128-bit   i128	  u128
    arch	    isize	  usize
  Floats:
    f32
    f64
  Boolean:
    bool
  Character:
    char
Compound Types:
Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types:
  Tuples.
  Arrays.
